# ftmq-api

Expose [followthemoney](https://followthemoney.tech) data via readonly [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). Data is stored in a *statement-based* store adapted by [ftmq](https://github.com/investigativedata/ftmq) from [nomenklatura](https://github.com/opensanctions/nomenklatura).

An example instance is deployed here: https://api.investigraph.dev

The api features filtering for `dataset`s, entity `Schema` and `Property` values, sorting and a search endpoint to query against a [full text search via `ftmq-search`](https://github.com/investigativedata/ftmq-search).

## Documentation

https://docs.investigraph.dev/lib/ftmq-api

## Development

This package is using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for packaging and dependencies management, so first [install it](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

Clone the repository to a local destination.

Within the root directory, run

    poetry install --with dev

This installs a few development dependencies, including [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) which needs to be registered:

    poetry run pre-commit install

Before creating a commit, this checks for correct code formatting (isort, black) and some other useful stuff (see: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`)

Spin up dev server and populate with fixtures data:

    make api

Run test & typing:

    make test
    make typecheck
